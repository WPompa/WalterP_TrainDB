# WalterP_TrainDB

Here is a PDF of the Train database I did with one of the best groups I've had the pleasure of working with.

It is our take on what a database for a train company could look like. We more or less took the approach of creating a document you could give to a client
alongside a verbal overview for such a database. It contains the statements you would need to create the database + statements that would be commonly used 
with the database.
